CheckIt is a mobile app that allows you to send and receive recommendations for content such as books, movies, podcasts, and more. You can keep track of who recommended what and when, manage your lists, and get real-time notifications for new recommendation. The app is built using React Native, Redux, socket.io, Node, Express, Sequelize, and PostgresQL.
